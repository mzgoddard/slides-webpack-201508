# slides about webpack

These are the slides for a small talk about webpack I gave at the BostonJS meetup in August 2015. The deck is also pulled together and built together by webpack. So meta.

### Dev it

```
npm install
grunt
# open localhost:8080
```

### Build it

```
npm install
grunt build
# check it out with serve or something
npm install -g serve
serve dist
```
